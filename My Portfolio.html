  <p class="m-lg-2">Grace is my name. One might say I'm a super social person ...well, I don't think so .So it's practically up to you to decide who I am to you.Right! Back on focus .I love playing Basketball,well it seems to always take away all my conflicting thoughts. I have a super amazing voice so one could say I'm a singer. I have a great passion for books...especially novels. I could read hours on end without stopping so... if you've got one, hit me up anytime! I love spending time with family (the fun times and the bad ones too). The most important aspect of all about me is that I love God. I might have been through so much but what matters is that God has been there through all of it with me.Otherwise, that's just me!</p>
